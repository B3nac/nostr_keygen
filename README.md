### Why

I was looking for the easiest way to generate `npub` and `nsec` keys myself locally without a ton of dependencies. There wasn't a solution out there for Python so here we are. Currently planning on building upon this example and adding various features. 

### Dependencies

Python3 and what's in the requirements.txt file.

If you have multiple Python versions or are worried about dependency conflicts I recommend using a virtual environment.

`python3 -m venv envname`

`source path/to/env/bin/activate`

else:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python3 nostr_keygen.py`

### What this script does currently

The script will print out the `npub` and `nsec` address that is randomly generated as well as ascii qrcodes for mobile clients.

#### In the works

- Add import private key function 
- Add CLI params for specific output
- Add a way to generate a specific number of key pairs
